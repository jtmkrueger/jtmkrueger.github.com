  Looking toward the horizon is most beautiful in the morning. It glows like a pink and orange fire that consumes everything as far as the eye can see. This is the best time to be out at the top of Canterhouse Hill. Trees take on a bright glow as their source of life begins its climb up out of darkness. Though the day before was scorching hot, the blackness of the night before had cooled the earth, and a thin layer of dew had formed on the foliage. It caused everything to shimmer in the early morning light. Everything in the valley below is illuminated with dawns all encompassing flame.

  Branford had been visiting this hilltop as far back as his memory served. The home he grew up in was no more than a mile back behind him. He knew the location of every rock, the age of every tree. All his childhood friends had moved on from this small community, but Branford had no reason to leave. Everything he wanted was here in this valley. Thimble creek had never run dry as far back as his family could remember, so he had an infinite source of water. Live in the rich ecosystem around this ancient watercourse was an abundant array of biodiversity. From the smallest mouse to the greatest bear, living things thrived in this place. It would be impossible to hunt out this valley alone.

  Branford surveyed everything below him with unblinking eyes. He was looking for any sign of movement. A moving branch, a puff of dust, anything that would indicate something alive was stirring within the valley. His favorite prey often stirred from slumber with parched throats, and would cautiously approach the stream to quench their thirst. This always presented itself as an ideal opportunity to catch a tired, thirsty creature out in the open. Branford scanned the brook from where it emerged from the canyon east of his position as far as his eye could see.
