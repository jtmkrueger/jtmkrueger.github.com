        1) Caring for the Earth. The Mo’ Betta Green MarketPlace conducts business on the core idea of proving the community of northeast Denver with "fresh, local, integris food™"<br /> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which means that the goods have a traceable origin, are organic, and local  <br />

        2) Caring for People. The MBG Marketplace takes it a step further by providing resources, information, education and policy;<br />

        3) Returning the Surplus. The MBG Marketplace sees itself as a cooperative economic marketplace for the vendors of the market <br /> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for the un/underserved neighborhoods surrounding the marketplace. <br /><br />

        Beverly states that “’the problem is the solution’ is a foundational strategy that has influenced this market’s design and it is the premise … <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that draws the vendors to this marketplace”

      <p>
        We started with intensive observation and evaluation of the client’s needs for this project. We found that in addition to a traditional garden design, the MBG Marketplace would greatly benefit from a streamlined plan that addresses the need for increased and diverse connections between the market and its community, vendors, and other businesses and non-profit organizations to help create beneficial.<br /> 
        We wanted to help Beverly catch and store energy and materials by amplifying her networks and using the resources available to her (such as the Crop Mob &amp; Occupy Denver Garden) during the increased popularity and awareness about healthy eating and living.<br />  <br />
        <b>The kick-off event will perform multiple functions including</b> <br /> 
        1) brining the community together to share in healthy food <br /> 
        2) workshops <br /> 
        3) networking opportunities <br /> 
        4) the arts and creative expression.<br /> <br />
        We hope that MBG MarketPlace’s network will continue to grow, bringing in different elements to help Beverly run the market and events more efficiently. <br /><br />  
        The key-hole garden design for the Sustainability Park plot where MBG MarketPlace will source its food for food demonstrations during market days optimizes edge and allows for easier maintenance and access to the plots.<br /> 
        We have implemented small scale, intensive systems by integrating companion plantings and plant guilds to bring out each crop’s natural strength and maximize yields in the long run. The plot will be nourished only using natural and organic methods and fertilizers. The plot will also be constructed using recycled or reclaimed materials and will integrate some yard farms concepts so that individuals can see what they can implement in their own homes.<br /><br /> Hopefully, this will spark the creativity for neighbors to imagine new ways to see and adapt their own personal food system.

       While the MBG MarketPlace has been doing outreach to various community entities there are still opportunities to grow. With limited staff capacity, our suggestion would be to make the least change for the greatest effect in already existing practices. There is a lot of buzz about the market already in place, let’s maximize that by making it easier for people to stay in the MBG loop.

        •	Tailor your messages. Speak to the different facets of the community. What would get them selling and/or buying at the market?

(for example, if you or a partner organization is hosting a window farm demo, target your outreach to apartment dwellers and senior living communities)<br /><br />
        •	Maximize your time by finding vendors, volunteers, and/or community members to write blogs, tweet, promote MBG MarketPlace on facebook, write articles (YourHub), and write press releases. <br /><br />
        •	Conduct a few focus groups and/or a short survey (maybe with a 10% or $10 coupon the participants can use at the market) to see what types of communication are effective, what components of the market people respond to, and the opportunities to grow. <br /><br />

        The first year the Mo Beta group will provide the necessary seeds for the sustainability park.<br /><br />

        Another sourcing of seeds would be seed swaps, several restaurants that just carry heirloom products, farm donations of seeds from existing crops, food banks that the vegetables are going bad as well as organic food stores that the produce is getting to old to sell.<br /><br />

        Also as the end of the season some of the crops as well as aged produce can be saved to be able to be turned into seed.  This will not only give a complete set of seeds for the sustainability park, but it will provide a venue and a potential to be able to teach other's about the process.  A well organized program of this will supply ample seeds for present uses as well as provide a seed bank to be able to expand and swap.<br /><br />

        The classes may be signed up for at the farmer's market events, a bulletin board at sustainability park or at various school's or church's in the neighborhood.  Also any other viable business site wanting to post and or neighborhood publications.  Also a Meet up group suggesting possibilities in the
        5 points area may also be a good way of getting the word out there. <br />  
        The classes could be held at close a school, church or business that may be able to host the event.  The classes could be a great start to be able to make the community more aware of food and health.  The classes would also bring together a greater collection of people to help support the market.
